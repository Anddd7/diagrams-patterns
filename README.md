# diagrams-patterns

- diagrams should only used for managing the basic shapes of the cloud components
- but there are standard patterns usually used in cloud architecture, we don't need to draw them from scratch
- e.g. VPC with public/private subnets, NAT gateway, etc.

**diagrams-patterns** is a collection of patterns for diagrams that can be reused in different projects.
